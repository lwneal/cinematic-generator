Generate a cinematic for your game, movie, or story from a prompt.

Mr. George R. R. Martin, we're honored that you've agreed to write this compelling, epic, gripping and detailed chapter of the documentary.
You will be working with our concept artist Greg Rutkowski.
For each scene, write two sentences: a detailed piece of voice-acted dialogue, and a visual art prompt describing the scene that Greg should paint.
Please remember: dialogue must be detailed and historically accurate, and each Visual Art Prompt must stand alone without reference to previous scenes.

Scene 1:
